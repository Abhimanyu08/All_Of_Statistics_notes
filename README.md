# All_Of_Statistics_notes
This repository contains notes of the book "All of Statistics" by Larry Wasserman. (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21736-9)

I write these notes as I go through the book slowly but steadily. These are mainly for my personal use but I would be glad if they could help somebody. Since I am naive at mathematics, these may contain some errors which I am happy to correct if pointed out.
